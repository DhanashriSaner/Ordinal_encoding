<h1> Ordinal_encoding</h1>
An Ordinal Encoder is used to encode categorical features into an ordinal numerical value (ordered set). This approach transforms categorical value into numerical value in ordered sets.<br>
This encoding technique appears almost similar to Label Encoding. But, label encoding would not consider whether a variable is ordinal or not, but in the case of ordinal encoding, it will assign a sequence of numerical values as per the order of data.<br>
